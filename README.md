# LC-ML (Laser Chaos-based Multi-processing Learning)

This repository contains scripts that implements the LC-ML algorithm, which aims to addresses the problem of stable acoustic relay assignment in
an underwater acoustic network, as discribed in our paper:

Stable Acoustic Relay Assignment with High Throughout via Laser Chaos-based Reinforcement Learning.

The source data for figures 4-8 in the paper is also contained in this dictionary.
